# RestAssuredCucumberFrameworkDesign
This is a Java-based automation framework designed to test the functionality of the 
practice dummy Google Maps API. The goal of this framework is to build a scalable 
and easy-to-maintain solution from scratch. The framework is supported by
Cucumber BDD, which helps to create readable and easily understandable test 
scenarios. With JUnit as an execution tool, it is easy to add useful plugins such as 
Extent Reporter without lots of code.

Also, you may face an issue when extent report has not been created after the test execution. To fix it just clean the project and start a new execution.
